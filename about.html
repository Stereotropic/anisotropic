<P class="text">Who Am I exactly? I'm Varcan or Lych33n or Octave, while that is a lot of names, you only need to worry about the first one. Also there were more names but those are all parts of a version of me that is long since gone. thankfully. anyways besides the straight yapping about my names, Im just a guy with too many projects too ambitious for my own talents. I also do your average online teenager activities like: Drawing! Playing Games! I also have a few websites I'm working on, though those will likely go nowhere as I do not have a place for them TO go. theyre just kind of a limbo for my ideas. IF youre reading this site, theres a rather good chance youve come from the abtmtr server. or you got here through my profile. if i decide to put it there. i probably will. Those pictures at the top will lead you back to the main page. the radio will add music if it not already playing.</P>
